## Expected Output
![output](./expected_output.png)

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## HOW TO USE THIS APP
The user only need to:

- Enter a valid zip code, followed by a comma(with no space) then country code (all lowercased) in the input area. (e.g. 166-0012,jp, 94040,us)
- Write a feeling in the textarea. For example "Its chilly outside"
- Hit then "Generate" button to get the weather information and feeling.
